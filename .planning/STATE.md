# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-06)

**Core value:** Staff can record every order (items, payments, discounts, expenses, images) and always see correct, server-computed totals and balances. Existing production data is carried over with zero loss.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Hosting Verification & Backend Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Hosting Verification & Backend Foundation) — EXECUTING

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in the PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions that affect current work:

- [Roadmap]: Took the 14-phase structure from research/SUMMARY.md and renumbered its Phase 1a/1b/1c as Phases 1–3. Inquiries were split out of the public-site phase into Phase 13, giving 17 phases. Legacy discovery, legacy import and cutover stay last (Prime Directive 11).
- [Roadmap]: Company Expenses (Phase 6) comes before Orders to prove the slice pattern. Orders are split three ways: domain & API (7), screens (8), images & jobs (9). The Admin Dashboard is added as Phase 10.
- [Roadmap]: Cross-cutting QUAL/SEC/A11Y/PERF requirements map to the phase where their gate is first built. The PRD §22 Definition of Done enforces them in every later phase.
- [Phase 01]: Owner approved the full Phase 1 package list (01-01 Task 1 legitimacy gate) on 2026-10-07 before first restore; recorded in docs/dependencies.json approvals
- [Phase 01]: Dependency registry scopes are runtime|build|test|tool|font; D-18 exceptions MPL-2.0->test, OFL-1.1->font; pin/registry mismatch fails DependencyRegistryTests
- [Phase 01]: xUnit v3 MTP: zero-match filter exits 8 (A14 first half confirmed); report switches are --report-xunit-junit/--report-xunit-trx
- [Phase 01]: CspsApiFactory keeps one public ctor (xUnit1056); the (string) ctor is protected and CspsApiFactory.ForDatabase(connectionString) is the public entry for real databases
- [Phase 01]: LocalDB (localdb)\CSPS 17.0 connects with Integrated Security and no TrustServerCertificate (A12 confirmed); CSPS_Dev is created by dotnet ef at compat 170 while EF SQL and test DBs are pinned to 160
- [Phase 01]: TestDatabaseName.IsDisposable also checks exact length because .NET $ matches before a trailing newline

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: The FND-13 hosting record needs SmarterASP.NET control-panel access, and the SMTP check needs a sender domain with DNS (C-45, OD-12). If access lags, the hosting spike runs last and the compatibility level is pinned provisionally.
- [Phase 3]: The owner must create the GitHub repo and provide Web Deploy credentials and secrets. C-27 (security tooling cost) must be ruled before CI.
- [Phase 4]: Send the security batch (OD-12, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-19, C-23, C-33) before the phase starts. Email delivery is a hard dependency for sign-in.
- [Phase 7]: All order rulings must close before the first test: OD-3 to OD-7, C-1, C-3, C-13, C-14, C-15/C-24, C-37 to C-39, C-42 to C-44.
- [Phase 9]: Needs a Cloudinary account and credentials, and the OD-9 / C-26 delivery ruling.
- [Phase 13]: The C-36 ruling may defer the whole phase to v2.
